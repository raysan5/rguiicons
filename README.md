## Usage

The tool is quite intuitive, the expected steps to follow are: 
 1. Choose the icon to edit from icons panel
 2. Edit the icon pixels in the right panel
 3. Select next icon for edit or export set/individual icon
 
NOTE: Icon changes are previewed in real time in the same tool! 

Once icons have been created/edited, they can be saved as a raygui-ready icon set (.rgi), exported as an embeddable `.h` **code file** or exported as a `.png` image. Note that the `.png` contains the icons ids information in a standard chunk (`tEXt`/`zTXt`).

 - raygui icon set file (`.rgi`) can be loaded by raygui using the function `GuiLoadIcons()`.

 - raygui icon set code file (`.h`) can be embedded into a raygui-based application just defining:

```c
#define RAYGUI_IMPLEMENTATION
#define RAYGUI_CUSTOM_ICONS     // Custom icons set required 
#include "gui_iconset.h"        // Custom icons set provided, generated with rGuiIcons tool
#include "raygui.h"
```
